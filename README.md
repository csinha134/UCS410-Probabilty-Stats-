# UCS410 Probability and Statistics

This repository contains a collection of RStudio programs related to probability distributions, created for the UCS410 Probability and Statistics course. These programs demonstrate various probability distribution concepts and calculations.

## Programs Included

1. **Normal Distribution**
   - Program: `normal_distribution.R`
   - Description: This program illustrates the properties of the normal distribution, including probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and random sampling from a normal distribution.

2. **Binomial Distribution**
   - Program: `binomial_distribution.R`
   - Description: This program covers the binomial distribution, showcasing probability mass function (PMF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), and calculating binomial probabilities.

3. **Poisson Distribution**
   - Program: `poisson_distribution.R`
   - Description: Explore the Poisson distribution with this program, which includes PMF, CDF, and Poisson probability calculations.

4. **Exponential Distribution**
   - Program: `exponential_distribution.R`
   - Description: Understand the exponential distribution with this program, which covers the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, and exponential random variable generation.

5. **Uniform Distribution**
   - Program: `uniform_distribution.R`
   - Description: This program demonstrates the uniform distribution, including the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, and generating random uniform values.

6. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Program: `hypothesis_testing.R`
   - Description: Implement hypothesis testing with different probability distributions and statistical tests. This program provides examples of t-tests, chi-square tests, and more.

## Getting Started

To run these programs, you need to have RStudio installed on your computer. You can download RStudio from the official website: [RStudio Download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Once you have RStudio installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open RStudio and load the program of your choice.
3. Run the R script in RStudio to execute the program.

Make sure you have the required R packages installed. You can install packages using the `install.packages()` function in R.
